# Welcome to the project!

GiFz is a decentralized file sharing app specialised for GIFs, originally based on [SilentShare](https://github.com/hackthedev/silentshare-shipping) and uses the [dSyncFiles library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hackthedev/dsync-files) which is based on [SilentShare](https://github.com/hackthedev/silentshare-shipping) and [DCTS](https://github.com/hackthedev/dcts-shipping).

The idea is to create a decentralized GIF sharing service with API to avoid single points of failure. It uses [dSync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hackthedev/dsync) for node communication as well as some other libraries from that family, like [dSyncFiles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hackthedev/dsync-files), [dSyncIPSec](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hackthedev/dsync-ipsec) and more.
